### Sapflow in tomato

Some time ago we performed a similar trial, but then we were focusing more on stem diameter than on sap flow, however, if you look at [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIL55mdzTqU) and will carefully observe the top part of the video, you will see that there is quite some leaf movement, so it should be pressure, what we could measure as a difference in sap flow.

Now, when we learn the underlying processes of plant responses to environmental practices, we will build better plant steering algorithms and cheaper ways to achieve more.

* In the graph, you can select or de-select the desired line by clicking on its legend at the top of the graph.
* You can change line scale by clicking at the top or bottom of the scale and dragging it in the desired direction.
* Line scale corresponds to the line color and its sequence number in the graph selection area above the top
* There is a tooltip bar at the top right corner of the graph
* You can draw on the graph by selecting the freehand tool or line tool
* You can save the graph as a .png file by selecting the camera icon
* Data source is embedded in the graph, if you know how to get it - you are free to do it
